# 2085 - Monster Game II

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are playing a game that consists of $n$ levels. Each level has a monster. On levels $1,2,\dots,n-1$, you can either kill or escape the monster. However, on level $n$ you must kill the final monster to win the game.

Killing a monster takes $sf$ time where $s$ is the monster's strength and $f$ is your skill factor. After killing a monster, you get a new skill factor (lower skill factor is better). What is the minimum total time in which you can win the game?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $x$: the number of levels and your initial skill factor.

The second line has $n$ integers $s\_1,s\_2,\dots,s\_n$: each monster's strength.

The third line has $n$ integers $f\_1,f\_2,\dots,f\_n$: your new skill factor after killing a monster.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum total time to win the game.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le x \le 10^6$
* $1 \le s\_i, f\_i \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
5 100
50 20 30 90 30
60 20 20 10 90
```

Output:

```cpp
2600
```

Explanation: The best way to play is to kill the second and fifth monster.
