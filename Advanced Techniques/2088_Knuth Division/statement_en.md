# 2088 - Knuth Division

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an array of $n$ numbers, your task is to divide it into $n$ subarrays, each of which has a single element.

On each move, you may choose any subarray and split it into two subarrays. The cost of such a move is the sum of values in the chosen subarray.

What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the array size. The array elements are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The second line has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum total cost.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 5000$
* $1 \le x\_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
5
2 7 3 2 5
```

Output:

```cpp
43
```
