# 2086 - Subarray Squares

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an array of $n$ elements, your task is to divide into $k$ subarrays. The cost of each subarray is the square of the sum of the values in the subarray. What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $k$: the array elements and the number of subarrays. The array elements are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The second line has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$: the contents of the array.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum total cost.

# Constraints

* $1 \le k \le n \le 3000$
* $1 \le x\_i \le 10^5$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
8 3
2 3 1 2 2 3 4 1
```

Output:

```cpp
110
```

Explanation: An optimal solution is $[2,3,1]$, $[2,2,3]$, $[4,1]$, whose cost is $(2+3+1)^2+(2+2+3)^2+(4+1)^2=110$.
