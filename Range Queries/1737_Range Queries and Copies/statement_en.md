# 1737 - Range Queries and Copies

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to maintain a list of arrays which initially has a single array. You have to process the following types of queries:

1. Set the value $a$ in array $k$ to $x$.
2. Calculate the sum of values in range $[a,b]$ in array $k$.
3. Create a copy of array $k$ and add it to the end of the list.

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $q$: the array size and the number of queries.

The next line has $n$ integers $t\_1,t\_2,\ldots,t\_n$: the initial contents of the array.

Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1 $k$ $a$ $x$", "2 $k$ $a$ $b$" or "3 $k$".

# Output

Print the answer to each sum query.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le t\_i, x \le 10^9$
* $1 \le a \le b \le n$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
5 6
2 3 1 2 5
3 1
2 1 1 5
2 2 1 5
1 2 2 5
2 1 1 5
2 2 1 5
```

Output:

```cpp
13
13
13
15
```
