A company has $n$ employees with certain salaries. Your task is to keep track of the salaries and process queries.

# Input

The first input line contains two integers $n$ and $q$: the number of employees and queries. The employees are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.

The next line has $n$ integers $p\_1,p\_2,\ldots,p\_n$: each employee's salary.

After this, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. Each line has one of the following forms:

* `!` $k$ $x$: change the salary of employee $k$ to $x$
* `?` $a$ $b$: count the number of employees whose salary is between $a \ldots b$

# Output

Print the answer to each `?` query.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le p\_i \le 10^9$
* $1 \le k \le n$
* $1 \le x \le 10^9$
* $1 \le a \le b \le 10^9$
