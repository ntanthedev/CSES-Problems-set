# 1188 - Bit Inversions

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There is a bit string consisting of $n$ bits. Then, there are some changes that invert one given bit. Your task is to report, after each change, the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same.

# Input

The first input line has a bit string consisting of $n$ bits. The bits are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.

The next line contains an integer $m$: the number of changes.

The last line contains $m$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\ldots,x\_m$ describing the changes.

# Output

After each change, print the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le x\_i \le n$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
001011
3
3 2 5
```

Output:

```cpp
4 2 3
```

Explanation: The bit string first becomes `000011`, then `010011`, and finally `010001`.
