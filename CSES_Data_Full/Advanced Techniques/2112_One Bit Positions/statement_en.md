# 2112 - One Bit Positions

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a binary string of length $n$. Your task is to calculate, for every $k$ between $1 \ldots n-1$, the number of ways we can choose two positions $i$ and $j$ such that $i-j=k$ and there is a one-bit at both positions.

# Input

The only input line has a string that consists only of characters $0$ and $1$.

# Output

For every distance $k$ between $1\ldots n-1$ print the number of ways we can choose two such positions.

# Constraints

* $2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
1001011010
```

Output:

```cpp
1 2 3 0 2 1 0 1 0
```
