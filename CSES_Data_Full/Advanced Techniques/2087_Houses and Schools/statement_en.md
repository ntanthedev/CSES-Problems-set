* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

There are $n$ houses on a street, numbered $1,2,\dots,n$. The distance of houses $a$ and $b$ is $|a-b|$. You know the number of children in each house.

Your task is to establish $k$ schools in such a way that each school is in some house. Then, each child goes to the nearest school. What is the minimum total walking distance of the children if you act optimally?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $k$: the number of houses and the number of schools. The houses are numbered $1,2\dots,n$.

After this, there are $n$ integers $c\_1,c\_2,\dots,c\_n$: the number of children in each house.

# Output

Print the minimum total distance.

# Constraints

* $1 \le k \le n \le 3000$
* $1 \le c\_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
6 2
2 7 1 4 6 4
```

Output:

```cpp
11
```

Explanation: Houses 2 and 5 will have schools.
