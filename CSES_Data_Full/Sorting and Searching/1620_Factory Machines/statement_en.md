# 1620 - Factory Machines

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A factory has $n$ machines which can be used to make products. Your goal is to make a total of $t$ products.

For each machine, you know the number of seconds it needs to make a single product. The machines can work simultaneously, and you can freely decide their schedule.

What is the shortest time needed to make $t$ products?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $t$: the number of machines and products.

The next line has $n$ integers $k\_1,k\_2,\dots,k\_n$: the time needed to make a product using each machine.

# Output

Print one integer: the minimum time needed to make $t$ products.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le t \le 10^9$
* $1 \le k\_i \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
3 7
3 2 5
```

Output:

```cpp
8
```

Explanation: Machine 1 makes two products, machine 2 makes four products and machine 3 makes one product.
