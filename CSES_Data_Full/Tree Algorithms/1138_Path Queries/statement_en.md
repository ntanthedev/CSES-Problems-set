# 1138 - Path Queries

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given a rooted tree consisting of $n$ nodes. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$, and node $1$ is the root. Each node has a value.

Your task is to process following types of queries:

1. change the value of node $s$ to $x$
2. calculate the sum of values on the path from the root to node $s$

# Input

The first input line contains two integers $n$ and $q$: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.

The next line has $n$ integers $v\_1,v\_2,\ldots,v\_n$: the value of each node.

Then there are $n-1$ lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$: there is an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.

Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form "1 $s$ $x$" or "2 $s$".

# Output

Print the answer to each query of type 2.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le a,b, s \le n$
* $1 \le v\_i, x \le 10^9$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
5 3
4 2 5 2 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
2 4
1 3 2
