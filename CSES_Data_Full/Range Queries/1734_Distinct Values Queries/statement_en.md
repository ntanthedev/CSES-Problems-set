# 1734 - Distinct Values Queries

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an array of $n$ integers and $q$ queries of the form: how many distinct values are there in a range $[a,b]$?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $q$: the array size and number of queries.

The next line has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$: the array values.

Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$.

# Output

For each query, print the number of distinct values in the range.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n,q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le x\_i \le 10^9$
* $1 \le a \le b \le n$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
5 3
3 2 3 1 2
1 3
2 4
1 5
```

Output:

```cpp
2
3
