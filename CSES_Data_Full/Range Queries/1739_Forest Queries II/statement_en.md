# 1739 - Forest Queries II

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You are given an $n \times n$ grid representing the map of a forest. Each square is either empty or has a tree. Your task is to process $q$ queries of the following types:

1. Change the state (empty/tree) of a square.
2. How many trees are inside a rectangle in the forest?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $q$: the size of the forest and the number of queries.

Then, there are $n$ lines describing the forest. Each line has $n$ characters: `.` is an empty square and `*` is a tree.

Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "$1$ $y$ $x$" or "2 $y\_1$ $x\_1$ $y\_2$ $x\_2$".

# Output

Print the answer to each query of the second type.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 1000$
* $1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le y,x \le n$
* $1 \le y\_1 \le y\_2 \le n$
* $1 \le x\_1 \le x\_2 \le n$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
4 3

*.**
**..
****
2 2 2 3 4
1 3 3
2 2 2 3 4
