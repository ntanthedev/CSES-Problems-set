# 1647 - Static Range Minimum Queries

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Given an array of $n$ integers, your task is to process $q$ queries of the form: what is the minimum value in range $[a,b]$?

# Input

The first input line has two integers $n$ and $q$: the number of values and queries.

The second line has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$: the array values.

Finally, there are $q$ lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$: what is the minimum value in range $[a,b]$?

# Output

Print the result of each query.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n,q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
* $1 \le x\_i \le 10^9$
* $1 \le a \le b \le n$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
8 4
3 2 4 5 1 1 5 3
2 4
5 6
1 8
3 3
```

Output:

```cpp
2
