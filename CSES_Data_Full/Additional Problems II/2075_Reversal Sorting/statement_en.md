# 2075 - Reversal Sorting

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

You have an array that contains a permutation of integers $1,2,\dots,n$. Your task is to sort the array in increasing order by reversing subarrays. You can construct any solution that has at most $n$ reversals.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the size of the array. The array elements are numbered $1,2,\dots,n$.

The next line has $n$ integers $x\_1,x\_2,\dots,x\_n$: the contents of the array.

# Output

First print an integer $k$: the number of reversals.

After that, print $k$ lines that describe the reversals. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$: you reverse a subarray from position $a$ to position $b$.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
4
2 3 1 4
```

Output:

```cpp
2
1 3
2 3
```
