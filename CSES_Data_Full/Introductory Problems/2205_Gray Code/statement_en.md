# 2205 - Gray Code

* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

A Gray code is a list of all $2^n$ bit strings of length $n$, where any two successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is one).

Your task is to create a Gray code for a given length $n$.

# Input

The only input line has an integer $n$.

# Output

Print $2^n$ lines that describe the Gray code. You can print any valid solution.

# Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 16$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
2
```

Output:

```cpp
00
01
11
10
```
