* **Time limit:** 1.00 s
* **Memory limit:** 512 MB

Your task is to calculate the number of valid bracket sequences of length $n$ when a *prefix* of the sequence is given.

# Input

The first input line has an integer $n$.

The second line has a string of $k$ characters: the prefix of the sequence.

# Output

Print the number of sequences modulo $10^9+7$.

# Constraints

* $1 \le k \le n \le 10^6$

# Example

Input:

```cpp
6
(()
```

Output:

```cpp
2
```

Explanation: There are two possible sequences: `(())()` and `(()())`.
